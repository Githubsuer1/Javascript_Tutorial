//loops are very powerful as they have the ability to repeat a code to many times as we want in our program.


// print first 10 natural num 
let num1 = 10;
let i = 1
while (i<=num1){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}


// print first 10 natural num in reverse order
let num2 = 10;
while (num2){
    console.log(num2);
    num2--;
}


// print first 10 even num 
let num3 = 10;
let j = 1;
while (j<=num3){
    console.log(i*2);
    i++;
}
